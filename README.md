# script.securitycam.hd

This kodi addon is based on the addon script.securitycam. While the original addon is capable of displaying a maximum of 4 camera feeds on the screen, the hd addon can display up to 9 camera feeds simultaneously. For the arrangement of the feeds you may either use preset sizes and positions or define individual settings per feed.

You can zoom a selected feed to full screen display by entering the numeric index of the desired feed on your remote or keyboard or press the enter / select key to show a menu which let's you select the feed (Please note: the index starts with 1 from top left to bottom right). While in zoom mode you can enter another feed's index or use the 'left (<)' and 'right (>)' key to toggle between different feeds. Use the 'back (<-)' key to return to the overview screen that shows all configured feeds. The back key will also close the addon when in overview mode. Alternatively, you can activate the auto close setting to close the addon after a spcified ammount of seconds.

Each camera needs to provide a jpeg snapshot or an rtsp stream (requires the installation of ffmpeg on your system) via the URL configured in the addon settings.
